I was born in Stockholm and currently live and work in Ioannina, Greece. Besides my studies at the [Department of Industrial Management of the Piraeus University](https://www.tex.unipi.gr/?lang=en) and my work position in the administration in the University of Ioannina, painting as an inner need, led me to study fine arts at the [School of Fine Arts of the University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr/en/education/departments/department-fine-arts-and-art-sciences/) and thus continue in the Department's postgraduate study program. I have since my graduation taken place in many group exhibitions along with my solo ones and I have worked on a lot of custom made art pieces and projects.

My main medium of expression is painting: intense, expressionistic colors, acrylics on canvas as well as charcoal on transparency. Painting is my way to express and communicate what concerns me and worries me from time to time. It is my way to approach others, to understand them, to interpret their behavior.

The main subject of my painting are people, their emotional world, their thoughts, their hidden wishes, their personalities.

The figures in my works are children but at the same time they are grown – ups, they live in a fantasy world but at the same time in reality, they live at the moment but as well in the past and they will exist in the future with the similar thoughts, concerns, anxieties, fears.

I also paint mythical creatures from my fantasy worlds and tulips, that are another kind of portrait, one for each special person.

As my art is dynamic and get inspired by my every day, I am eager to see what’s next in my painting.
