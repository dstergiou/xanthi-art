  - name: dancing
    img: assets/images/lord/01-dancing.jpg
    desc: He began to dance while his laugh turned into a deathly growl<br />I render expressionistically with intense color the transformation of the child into a wild animal.
  - name: kill_the_beast
    img: assets/images/lord/02-kill_the_beast.jpg
    desc: Kill the beast<br />When they kill a living creature for the first time, they begin to be overcome by wild killing instincts. I render the form with faded strokes, coming out of a cloudy landscape, as cloudy as the dark side of human existence.
  - name: jack_the_hunter
    img: assets/images/lord/03-jack_the_hunter.jpg
    desc: Jack the hunter<br />With no traces of civilization on them anymore, without clothes they hunt to feed with the dominant feeling of survival. The boundary is lost between civilization and barbarism and thus is attributed to the canvas with the dominant white foggy color.
  - name: the_lord_of_the_flies
    img: assets/images/lord/04-the_lord_of_the_flies.jpg
    desc: The Lord of the Flies<br />The Lord of the Flies dies in the end. The prophecy was fulfilled. The beast, the evil was always within them. I render the form almost humanly indicating that the Lord of the Flies has always been the same. His words were the words of their conscience.
  - name: sacrifice
    img: assets/images/lord/05-the_sacrifice.jpg
    desc: The sacrifice<br />The severed head of the pig. I present it fully alive and imposing. It is the vehicle of the Lord of the Flies and consequently of his prophecies.
  - name: leader
    img: assets/images/lord/06_leader.jpg
    desc: You chose me as your leader. You are now under my commands<br />With the central figure dominant and with a more intense color I present the fury of power.
  - name: death_come
    img: assets/images/lord/07-eventually_death_come.jpg
    desc: Eventually death came<br />The end of the innocence of the human species, which is sealed with the first murder of one of the children, is highlighted through the intense yellow and pink color.
  - name: darkness
    img: assets/images/lord/08-darkness.jpg
    desc: They couldn&#39;t escape from the darkness of human existence<br />In deep blue I mark the abyss into which they fall in.
  - name: beast
    img: assets/images/lord/09-the_beast_is_inside_us.jpg
    desc: The beast is inside us<br />With bright yellow and expressionistic touches I render the unknown, the beast that was always inside them.

All of the paintings in this session, are my artistic approach to human existence based on the Nobel
prized novel “The Lord of the flies” by William Golding.

William Golding deals with the timeless questions about human nature: how a group of students,
school aged from 6 to 12 years old, find themselves alone on a deserted, beautiful island, and in
their attempt to organize themselves into society end up in extreme situations of violence and fear.

It is a hard book, because its heroes, even though they are children, are not what the reader would
expect, i.e. "children" carefree and innocent, but they end up becoming violent, cruel, murderous.
And while they begin democratically to organize a society with the values and rules they had learned
in the society of the adults, they fall into situations of division, brutality and go as far as
exterminating each other.

Despite its brutality, the novel has great pedagogical value, due to its allegorical character, and due
to the fact that the heroes are children, which is why many schools and universities have included it
in their curriculum.
