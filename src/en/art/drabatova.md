In the eastern side of the Pamvotis Lake, in a Town of Greece called Ioannina is the homeland of the magical creatures of Drabatova.

They are so tiny and aerial, like the wind that you cannot see them but you can only feel them when they are near you.

Just stand near the lake side, close your eyes, be quiet, open your mind and your heart and if you are lucky you enough, you will feel them near you.

Every little one of the magical creatures has its unique magical power. And according to your problem it approaches you in order to help you.

How is this possible? Don’t ask. Just believe! Whoever had the chance to meet them knows it’s true. It’s just magic! People pass the story to their children through time.

But a chance to meet them, can only happen one period, in February. If you are lucky enough to meet with one of them you will have a lifetime experience. You will never feel alone again.
