A Greek myth talks about goblins. They are malevolent creatures that live in the bowels of the earth and all the time they are sawing the tree on which the earth rests.

They come to the surface in the evenings, on the days when Christmas is celebrated, and do damage to peopleâ€™s homes. When Christmas is over and they go back to their place, they find the Earth tree intact because of the Christmas miracle and they start sawing it again.
