There are some times that I want to take a break form my colorful paintings and I turn then to one other of my favorites media: charcoal on transparent paper.

I love the way it moves on the paper and form my portraits. The light through the transparency paper helps the forming of the portraits as well.

In “People I” the portraits are from a period that I needed to calm down and relax.
