intro:
  23 Days, so long was the period that I had to stay away from my children, 3 and 6 years old, due to a health issue.

  That was the most difficult period of my life. It was so hard not being able to see them in their everyday lives. I was never apart from them till that moment.<br/>

  How did they feel? What did they think about my absence? Were there any worries they had? Did they fear of anything? What did they dream at that time? What did they wish for?

  All those thoughts were so harsh to deal with.<br/>

  There was only one way to calm down, to put all these on canvas.<br/>

  All of the paintings from the series “23 Days” are inspired by that period.<br/>
